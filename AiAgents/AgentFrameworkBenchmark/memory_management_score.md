# Memory Management Benchmark

| **Framework** | **Abstraction Grade** | **Code Readability & Simplicity** | **Setup Complexity** | **Developer Experience (DX)** | **Documentation & Clarity** | **Flexibility & Customization** | **Total** |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| **AutoGen** | 1 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 10 | 23 |
| **CrewAI** | 8 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 4 | 41 |
| **LangChain Langraph** | 7 | 8 | 7 | 8 | 10 | 10 | 50 |
| **LlamaIndex** | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 33 |
| **OpenAI** | 10 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 7 | 3 | 47 |
| **Semantic Kernel** | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 10 | 19 |

## Scoring Scale: 1-10
- **Abstraction Grade**: Higher = More hidden complexity
- **All other metrics**: Higher = Better

## Key Insights

### High-Level Frameworks (Best for Rapid Development)
- **LangGraph** (50): Best overall - seamless state-based memory with checkpointing, perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility with superior developer experience
- **OpenAI** (47): Maximum abstraction - SQLiteSession handles everything automatically with zero developer intervention
- **CrewAI** (41): Declarative three-tier memory system with automatic coordination

### Middle Ground (Balance of Control & Convenience)
- **LlamaIndex** (33): Provides sophisticated components but requires custom session management and coordination

### Full Control Frameworks (Maximum Flexibility, Maximum Effort)
- **AutoGen** (23): Zero memory utilities - requires complete vanilla-style implementation
- **Semantic Kernel** (19): Zero utilities PLUS framework integration overhead

## Framework Recommendations

**Choose LangGraph if:** You want the best memory management framework (50/60) with powerful features, perfect documentation, maximum flexibility, and excellent developer experience. State-based checkpointing provides both convenience and complete control.

**Choose OpenAI if:** You want minimal code and maximum productivity. Just pass a session parameter and everything is handled automatically with zero configuration.

**Choose CrewAI if:** You want powerful declarative memory features without building from scratch, and the three-tier memory approach fits your mental model.

**Choose LlamaIndex if:** You need intelligent token-aware memory management with more control over the implementation details.

**Avoid AutoGen/Semantic Kernel if:** Memory management is critical to your application - they provide no utilities and require full vanilla-level implementation complexity.
