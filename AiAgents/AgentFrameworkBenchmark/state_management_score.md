# State Management Benchmark

| **Framework** | **Abstraction Grade** | **Code Readability & Simplicity** | **Setup Complexity** | **Developer Experience (DX)** | **Documentation & Clarity** | **Flexibility & Customization** | **Total** |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| **AutoGen** | 2 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 9 | **39** |
| **CrewAI** | 8 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 3 | **32** |
| **Langchain Langraph** | 9 | 7 | 3 | 7 | 10 | 10 | **46** |
| **LlamaIndex** | 10 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 2 | **32** |
| **OpenAI** | 3 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 8 | **40** |
| **Semantic Kernel** | 3 | 6 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 7 | **29** |

## Scoring Scale: 1-10
- **Abstraction Grade**: Higher = More hidden complexity
- **All other metrics**: Higher = Better

## Key Insights

### High-Abstraction Frameworks (Automated State Handling)
- **LangGraph** (46): High abstraction (9) with type-safe automatic state merging - perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility make complex state management approachable
- **OpenAI** (40): Low abstraction (3) but excellent balance - maintains high flexibility (8) with simple, readable code for teams wanting control without complexity
- **AutoGen** (39): Minimal abstraction (2) with straightforward state passing - near-complete flexibility (9) but you build automation yourself

### Middle Ground (Trade-offs in Visibility)
- **CrewAI** (32): High abstraction (8) through memory layers but impacts readability (5) and severely limits flexibility (3)
- **LlamaIndex** (32): Maximum abstraction (10) completely hides complexity but offers minimal flexibility (2) - automatic handling at the cost of control

### Lower-Tier Framework
- **Semantic Kernel** (29): Low abstraction (3) with callback-based coordination - struggles with documentation (4) and overall developer experience

## Framework Recommendations

**Choose LangGraph if:** You need sophisticated state management with maximum flexibility. Perfect 10s in documentation and customization, plus type-safe automatic merging, make it ideal for complex workflows where you need both power and control.

**Choose OpenAI if:** You want explicit control over state without excessive complexity. Low abstraction with high flexibility (8) and excellent readability (8) make it perfect for teams that understand their state needs.

**Choose AutoGen if:** You need minimal framework interference and near-complete flexibility (9). Simple state passing between agents with excellent readability (8) - ideal when you want to build custom state automation.

**Avoid LlamaIndex for complex state:** Maximum abstraction (10) hides everything but provides almost no flexibility (2). Only suitable for simple, standard state patterns.

**Avoid CrewAI if state control matters:** High abstraction through memory layers sounds convenient but limits flexibility to just 3 out of 10 while hurting readability.

**Avoid Semantic Kernel unless necessary:** Callback-based coordination with poor documentation (4) makes state management unnecessarily difficult.
