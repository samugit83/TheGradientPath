## Scoring Scale: 1-10
- **Abstraction Grade**: Higher = More hidden complexity
- **All other metrics**: Higher = Better

## Key Insights

### Top-Tier Frameworks (Best for Tool Integration)
- **CrewAI** (51): Maximum simplicity - Pydantic-powered automatic schema generation, minimal boilerplate, just define BaseModel + _run method
- **LangGraph** (50): Perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility - decorator-based with excellent state management and customization
- **OpenAI** (50): Clean context wrapper pattern with RunContextWrapper, intuitive and easy to debug

### Middle Ground (Solid Tool Support)
- **Semantic Kernel** (43): Enterprise-grade plugin architecture with clean class-based organization and automatic discovery
- **LlamaIndex** (40): Workflow-integrated tools with transactional state management, but requires understanding workflow concepts

### Challenging Implementation (High Complexity)
- **AutoGen** (27): Most complex approach with runtime introspection and dynamic signature manipulation - difficult to debug and fragile

## Framework Recommendations

**Choose CrewAI if:** You want the absolute simplest tool implementation. Pydantic handles all schema generation and validation automatically - just define your input model and _run method.

**Choose LangGraph if:** You need maximum flexibility and customization with excellent documentation. The decorator-based approach with state binding provides complete control while maintaining clean code.

**Choose OpenAI if:** You want clean, explicit context passing with native async support. The RunContextWrapper pattern is intuitive and easy to understand.

**Choose Semantic Kernel if:** You prefer class-based organization with enterprise patterns. The plugin architecture provides clear separation and automatic discovery.

**Choose LlamaIndex if:** You're already using workflows and need transactional state management with type annotations for parameter documentation.

**Avoid AutoGen if:** You value simplicity and maintainability - its complex runtime introspection with signature manipulation makes it the hardest to debug and most fragile to changes.
