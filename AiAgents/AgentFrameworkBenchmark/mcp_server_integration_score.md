## Scoring Scale: 1-10
- **Abstraction Grade**: Higher = More hidden complexity
- **All other metrics**: Higher = Better

## Key Insights

### Gold Standard (Maximum Productivity)
- **OpenAI** (51): Superior MCP support with minimal-configuration integration. MCP servers work as near-native agent capabilities - pass an `mcp_servers` parameter with simple setup and everything works. No complex adapters, minimal wrappers or protocol implementations needed. The disadvantage is framework lock-in to OpenAI's ecosystem.

### High-Level Abstraction Frameworks (Best for Most Use Cases)
- **AutoGen** (46): Single function call (`mcp_server_tools()`) replaces 500+ lines of vanilla code. Handles subprocess management, JSON-RPC protocol, and schema conversion automatically. Seamless integration with agents as `workbench_tools`.
- **LlamaIndex** (46): Built-in `BasicMCPClient` with unified tool loading via `aget_tools_from_mcp_url`. MCP tools become native `FunctionTool` instances, seamlessly mixed with regular tools. Clean, intuitive API.

### Middle Ground (Balanced Approach)
- **LangChain/LangGraph** (42): Improved MCP integration using official MCP Python library for full specification compliance. Better async/sync bridging patterns and cleaner context management. Maintains maximum flexibility (9/10) with solid readability and developer experience. Best choice when MCP spec compliance matters but with improved ease of use.
- **CrewAI** (42): Adapter pattern provides clean separation between MCP protocol and CrewAI's tool ecosystem. Features lazy tool loading, connection pooling, and global caching. Slightly more visible complexity but more control over the adapter layer.

### Avoid for MCP Integration
- **Semantic Kernel** (19): Zero abstraction utilities - requires complete vanilla-style implementation (subprocess management, JSON-RPC protocol, schema conversion) PLUS adaptation to Semantic Kernel's plugin standards. More complex than vanilla development.

## Framework Recommendations

**Choose OpenAI if:** You want maximum abstraction and minimal code (51/60). MCP servers work as near-native capabilities with minimal integration effort. Accept framework lock-in for excellent productivity.

**Choose AutoGen or LlamaIndex if:** You want powerful MCP integration with minimal code while maintaining framework flexibility. Both offer single-function-call simplicity (46/60) with excellent tool integration.

**Choose LangChain/LangGraph if:** MCP specification compliance is important, you need access to all protocol features with maximum flexibility (9/10), or you're already invested in LangChain's ecosystem. Improved implementation (42/60) makes async/sync bridging cleaner than before.

**Choose CrewAI if:** You prefer the adapter pattern (42/60) for cleaner separation of concerns, or you need direct access to the adapter layer for advanced use cases.

**Avoid Semantic Kernel if:** MCP integration is important to your application. It provides zero utilities and requires building everything from scratch, with additional complexity from plugin adaptation requirements.

## Complexity Comparison to Vanilla

**Vanilla Implementation Baseline:**
- 500+ lines of infrastructure code
- Manual subprocess spawning and management
- Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol implementation
- Custom adapter classes for schema conversion
- Manual resource cleanup and error handling

**Framework Abstractions:**
- **OpenAI**: Reduces 500+ lines to minimal config (98% reduction)
- **AutoGen/LlamaIndex**: Reduces to ~20 lines with single function calls (96% reduction)
- **LangChain**: Reduces to ~35 lines with improved patterns (93% reduction)
- **CrewAI**: Reduces to ~30 lines with adapter pattern (94% reduction)
- **Semantic Kernel**: Same as vanilla + plugin overhead (0% reduction, actually worse)
