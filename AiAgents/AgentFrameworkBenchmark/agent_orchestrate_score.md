# Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework Benchmark

| **Framework** | **Abstraction Grade** | **Code Readability & Simplicity** | **Setup Complexity** | **Developer Experience (DX)** | **Documentation & Clarity** | **Flexibility & Customization** | **Total** |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| **AutoGen** | 9 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | **27** |
| **CrewAI** | 10 | 9 | 9 | 7 | 5 | 2 | **42** |
| **Langchain Langraph** | 7 | 6 | 6 | 9 | 10 | 10 | **48** |
| **LlamaIndex** | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 7 | **41** |
| **OpenAI** | 4 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 6 | **45** |
| **Semantic Kernel** | 6 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 7 | **39** |

## Scoring Scale: 1-10
- **Abstraction Grade**: Higher = More hidden complexity
- **All other metrics**: Higher = Better

## Key Insights

### Top-Tier Framework (Best Overall)
- **LangGraph** (48): Highest overall score with perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility - state machine architecture provides maximum customization with excellent developer experience

### High-Level Frameworks (Best for Rapid Development)
- **OpenAI** (45): Clean APIs with minimal overhead and excellent developer experience for quick prototyping
- **CrewAI** (42): Highest abstraction level with a black-box approach - absolute simplicity but locked into delegation patterns

### Balanced Frameworks (Solid Middle Ground)
- **LlamaIndex** (41): Comfortable middle ground with balanced metrics across all areas - avoids extremes in both directions
- **Semantic Kernel** (39): Moderate abstraction with balanced approach but no standout features

### Challenging Implementation (High Complexity)
- **AutoGen** (27): Enterprise-grade infrastructure with high abstraction but poor readability, complex setup, and challenging developer experience

## Framework Recommendations

**Choose LangGraph if:** You want the best overall experience for multi-agent orchestration. Perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility, combined with excellent developer experience, make it ideal for sophisticated workflows with precise control.

**Choose OpenAI if:** You prioritize rapid development and clean APIs. Excellent developer experience with minimal overhead makes it great for quick prototyping and straightforward production use cases.

**Choose CrewAI if:** You need absolute simplicity and don't require customization. Perfect for straightforward delegation patterns where debugging complexity is acceptable.

**Choose LlamaIndex if:** You want a safe, balanced option without extreme trade-offs in any direction. Good for teams wanting moderate complexity and flexibility.

**Avoid AutoGen unless:** You specifically need enterprise-grade infrastructure and have the expertise to manage complex async wrappers and runtime registration.
