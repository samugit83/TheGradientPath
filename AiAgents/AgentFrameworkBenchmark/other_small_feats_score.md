## Scoring Scale: 1-10
- **Abstraction Grade**: Higher = More hidden complexity
- **All other metrics**: Higher = Better

## Key Insights

### High-Level Frameworks (Best for Rapid Development)
- **LangChain** (48): Leads with perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility, plus improved readability and setup scores. Best-in-class token tracking via `get_openai_callback` with automatic cost calculation. Offers `with_structured_output` utility and graph-based safety routing. Maximum customization potential while maintaining excellent utility support.
- **OpenAI** (44): Strong second place with declarative structured output (`output_type`), automatic input guardrails (`@input_guardrail` decorator), and clean usage tracking. Only Docker-based code execution is missing, but provides polished developer experience overall.

### Middle Ground (Balanced Approach)
- **CrewAI** (41): Excellent Pydantic integration for structured output, automatic usage metrics collection, but relies on vanilla subprocess for code execution and manual agent-based safety checks.

### Lower Abstraction (More Manual Work)
- **LlamaIndex** (35): Provides `TokenCountingHandler` but requires manual state management. Structured output needs complex markdown extraction. Safety through FunctionAgent requires manual handoff logic.
- **AutoGen** (33): Only standout feature is Docker-based code execution with true sandboxing. Otherwise manual JSON parsing, manual token tracking, and vanilla-style safety checks. High flexibility but low abstraction.

### Minimal Utilities Framework
- **Semantic Kernel** (29): Lowest score - provides almost no utilities for these features. Requires manual tiktoken calculations (estimates only), manual JSON parsing, no code execution abstractions, and no guardrail utilities. Maximum flexibility but maximum effort.

## Framework Recommendations

**Choose LangChain if:** You want the best combination of utility support and customization potential. Perfect 10s in documentation and flexibility, best-in-class token tracking with automatic cost calculation via `get_openai_callback`, and `with_structured_output` utility. Ideal when you need powerful features with maximum control.

**Choose OpenAI if:** You want the cleanest developer experience with structured output guaranteed by API, declarative guardrails that attach via decorators, and automatic safety enforcement. Best for rapid development with minimal boilerplate.

**Choose CrewAI if:** You need excellent Pydantic integration for type-safe outputs and automatic usage metrics collection. The agent-based patterns fit your mental model and you don't need Docker-based code isolation.

**Choose AutoGen if:** You're executing untrusted AI-generated code and need true Docker-based sandboxing. The only framework providing production-ready code isolation out of the box.

**Avoid Semantic Kernel if:** These utility features matter to your application - it provides the least framework support and requires building everything from scratch while dealing with framework integration overhead.
