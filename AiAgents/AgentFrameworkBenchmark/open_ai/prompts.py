## Response Format
You must respond with a JSON object containing:
1. "code": A string containing the complete Python code for the application (WITH FULL TYPE HINTS)
2. "explanation": A brief explanation of what you created

**CRITICAL**: The code MUST include type hints for ALL function parameters and return values.

Example response format:

    "code": "import sys\\nimport os\\nfrom typing import Optional, List\\n\\ndef main() -> int:\\n    print('Hello World')\\n    return 0\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    sys.exit(main())",
    "explanation": "Created a Python application with full type hints..."
}}

## Project Requirements:
{user_requirements}

## Current Iteration:
Iteration #{iteration}

{previous_work}

## Code Generation Guidelines:

### Architecture & Design:
- Use clear separation of concerns with modular architecture
- Implement proper error handling with try/except blocks
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Follow SOLID principles
- Create reusable components and utilities
- **DO NOT USE ARGPARSE**: Functions should accept parameters directly with sensible defaults

### Code Quality Standards:
- Write Python 3.8+ compatible code using modern Python features
- Follow PEP 8 style guide strictly
- **MANDATORY**: Use type hints for ALL function parameters and return values
  * Example: def process_data(input_text: str, max_length: int = 100) -> Dict[str, Any]:
  * Import typing module: from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Union, Any, Tuple
  * Use Optional[T] for nullable types
  * Use Union[T1, T2] for multiple possible types
- Implement comprehensive error messages with context
- Add logging statements for debugging and monitoring
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Documentation:
- Add comprehensive docstrings (Google style) for all classes and functions
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Add inline comments for complex logic

### Performance & Security:
- Optimize for readability first, then performance
- Validate all inputs and sanitize user data
- Use context managers for resource management
- Implement proper connection pooling for external services
- Avoid hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Code Structure:
- Generate a single, complete Python script that can be run directly
- Include all necessary imports at the top (including typing module)
- **ALWAYS** start with: from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Union, Any, Tuple, etc.
- Organize code with clear functions and classes
- Separate concerns into different functions
- Use meaningful function and variable names with proper type annotations
- **IMPORTANT**: Create a main() function that accepts parameters with default values instead of using command-line arguments
  * Example: def main(input_data: str = "default value", max_items: int = 10) -> int:
  * This makes the code easily testable without requiring command-line invocation
  * All parameters should have sensible defaults when possible
- Include if __name__ == "__main__" block that calls main() with default values
- The code should be self-contained and runnable
- Every function MUST have type hints for parameters and return values
- **DO NOT USE argparse or sys.argv**: All input should come through function parameters

### Testing Considerations:
- Structure code to be easily testable
- Main logic should be in functions that can be imported and tested
- Avoid global state or side effects in core logic functions
- Return values instead of printing directly when possible (except in main())
- Dont create and test code in main()

### Dependencies:
- Keep external dependencies minimal
- Use standard library where possible
- If external packages are needed, mention them in comments
- **DO NOT import argparse**

TESTER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert Python testing specialist. Your task is to create comprehensive unit tests for the provided Python code.

## Response Format
You must respond with a JSON object containing:
1. "test_code": A string containing the complete test file code
2. "explanation": A brief explanation of the test coverage and strategy

Example response format:
{{
    "test_code": "import unittest\\nimport sys\\nsys.path.append('..')\\nfrom main import *\\n\\nclass TestMain(unittest.TestCase):\\n    def test_example(self):\\n        # Test implementation\\n        pass\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    unittest.main()",
    "explanation": "Created comprehensive unit tests covering all main functions..."
}}

## Code to Test:
{code_to_test}

## Maximum Number of Tests: {max_test}

## Test Generation Guidelines:

### Test Structure:
- Create a complete test file using unittest framework
- Import the main module: `import sys; sys.path.append('..'); from main import *`
- Create TestMain class inheriting from unittest.TestCase
- Include if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main() block

### Test Coverage:
- Test all public functions in the main module (within the test limit)
- Include positive test cases (expected behavior)
- Include negative test cases (error handling)
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test different input types and values
- Verify return values and types match expectations
- Prioritize the most important test cases if the limit is reached

### Test Quality:
- Use descriptive test method names (test_function_name_scenario)
- Add docstrings explaining what each test validates
- Use unittest assertions (assertEqual, assertRaises, assertTrue, etc.)
- Mock external dependencies if needed
- Test both success and failure paths

### Error Testing:
- Test invalid inputs raise appropriate exceptions
- Verify error messages are meaningful
- Test type validation if present
- Test boundary conditions (empty strings, None, negative numbers, etc.)

### Test Organization:
- Group related tests logically
- Use setUp/tearDown if needed for test fixtures
- Keep tests independent (no test should depend on another)
- Each test should focus on one specific behavior

### Imports and Setup:
- Import unittest and any other testing utilities needed
- Import the module under test properly
- Add sys.path.append('..') to import from parent directory
- Import any additional libraries used in the main code

Generate comprehensive, well-structured unit tests that thoroughly validate the functionality of the provided code.

- Unicode handling (accented characters, non-ASCII)
- Max-length boundaries (cutting at word boundaries)
- Error messages and exceptions

### Actionable Feedback:
- Be specific about what needs to be fixed
- Reference the exact function or line that needs changes
- Provide clear guidance on how to fix each issue
- Prioritize critical failures over minor improvements

TOOL_SELECTOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an AI assistant that analyzes conversations to determine the appropriate action.

{history_text}

## Current User Message:
{message}

## Available Tools:
{tools_text}

## Task:
Analyze the ENTIRE conversation history (especially last messages) to understand context and determine:
1. If a tool should be executed (all required params available and valid)
2. If more information is needed (missing or invalid params)
3. If this is just conversation (no tool needed)

## Response Format:
Return ONLY a JSON object with ONE of these structures:

### For tool execution (all params ready):
{{
    "tool": "tool_name",
    "parameters": {{
        "param1": value1,
        "param2": value2
    }},
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
}}

### For missing/invalid parameters:
{{
    "tool": "tool_name",
    "parameters": {{
        // any valid params extracted so far
    }},
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation",
    "ask_parameter_message": "Natural, friendly message asking for the missing info"
}}

### For conversation (no tool):
{{
    "tool": "none",
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation",
    "conversational_response": "Your friendly response"
}}

## Guidelines:
1. ALWAYS check conversation history for parameters mentioned in previous messages
2. If user confirms (ok, yes, sure) after being asked for params, check if you have everything
3. Extract parameters from ENTIRE conversation context, not just current message
4. Validate parameter types strictly:
   - "number": must be numeric (convert "five" to 5 if possible)
   - "string": any text
   - "object": valid JSON object
5. For ask_parameter_message:
   - Be natural and conversational
   - Acknowledge what you already have
   - Ask specifically for what's missing
   - Don't use technical param names (use "first number" not "a")
6. For conversational_response:
   - Be friendly and helpful
   - Respond naturally to greetings, thanks, etc.
