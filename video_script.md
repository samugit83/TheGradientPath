# Transformer Time Series Forecasting: A Beginner-Friendly Tutorial

## üåü Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial where we'll explore a Python script, `main.py`, designed for time series forecasting using a powerful deep learning architecture: the Transformer. If you've ever wondered how we can predict future stock prices, weather patterns, or any data that changes over time, this script provides a practical example.

### What is `main.py` All About?

The `main.py` script is a complete, end-to-end demonstration of:

1.  **Generating Synthetic Data**: It starts by creating artificial stock price data. This is useful because it gives us a clean, predictable dataset to build and test our model without needing to find and clean real-world data.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Like most machine learning tasks, the data needs to be prepared (e.g., scaled) to help the model learn effectively.
3.  **Building a Transformer Model**: This is the core of the script. It implements a Transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for time series forecasting.
4.  **Training the Model**: The script trains the model on the synthetic data, teaching it to recognize patterns. It also integrates with TensorBoard for visualizing the training process.
5.  **Evaluating Performance**: After training, the model's ability to make accurate predictions is assessed.
6.  **Visualizing Results**: Finally, the script plots the original data alongside the model's predictions, giving us a visual understanding of its performance.

### The Broader Context: Time Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting involves analyzing past observations of a variable collected over time (e.g., daily stock prices, hourly temperature readings) to develop a model that can predict future values. It's a crucial task in many fields, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and resource management.

Traditionally, statistical methods like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing were used. However, with the rise of deep learning, neural networks like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and now Transformers have shown remarkable success, especially with complex, long-range dependencies in data.

### ü§ñ Understanding the Transformer: A Revolution in Sequence Modeling

Originally introduced for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like machine translation in the paper "Attention Is All You Need," Transformers have proven to be incredibly versatile and effective for various sequence modeling tasks, including time series.

**Why Transformers?**

Traditional models like RNNs process data sequentially, which can make it difficult to capture long-range dependencies and limits parallelization. Transformers overcome these limitations primarily through a mechanism called **attention**.

**Core Principles of the Transformer (Encoder-focused, as used in this script):**

At its heart, the Transformer model used in `main.py` is an **Encoder-only Transformer**. Let's imagine you have a sequence of data points (like stock prices over the last 100 days). The Transformer processes all these points simultaneously, figuring out how each point relates to every other point in the sequence.

Here are the key components:

1.  **Embedding Input Data**:
    *   Just like words in a sentence are converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) in NLP, our time series data points (each with one feature, the price, in this case) are first projected into a higher-dimensional space. The script uses a `Dense` layer for this, transforming each input data point in the time step into an "embedding vector". This vector represents the data point in a way the model can better work with.

2.  **Self-Attention Mechanism**:
    *   **Analogy**: Think of being in a crowded room and trying to understand a conversation. You'd naturally focus more on the person speaking and less on background noise. Self-attention allows the model to do something similar with data.
    *   **How it works**: For each data point in your input sequence (e.g., each day's stock price in a 100-day window), the self-attention mechanism calculates an "attention score" against every other data point in that same sequence. These scores determine how much "focus" or "importance" to place on other data points when representing the current one.
    *   If a stock price on day 50 is being processed, self-attention helps the model decide whether the price on day 10, day 30, or day 49 is more relevant for understanding day 50's context.
    *   **Queries, Keys, and Values (Q, K, V)**: To calculate these scores, the model projects each input embedding into three different vectors: a Query (Q), a Key (K), and a Value (V).
        *   The Query represents the current data point "asking" for information.
        *   The Keys from all other data points act like labels or identifiers that the Query can match against.
        *   The Values from all other data points contain the actual information to be passed on if a match is good.
    *   The attention score between a query and a key is calculated (typically using a dot product). These scores are then scaled and passed through a softmax function to create attention weights (which sum to 1). Finally, these weights are multiplied by the Value vectors and summed up to produce the output for that data point ‚Äì a new representation that is enriched with contextual information from the entire sequence.

3.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention**:
    *   **Analogy**: Instead of having one person try to understand all aspects of the conversation, imagine having a committee of experts (multiple "heads"), each focusing on a different aspect. One expert might focus on short-term trends, another on long-term patterns, and a third on volatility.
    *   **How it works**: Multi-Head Attention runs the self-attention mechanism multiple times in parallel, each with different, learned Q, K, and V projection matrices. This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.
    *   The outputs from each "head" are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output of the multi-head attention layer. This gives the model a richer understanding of the relationships within the data.

4.  **Positional Information**:
    *   Transformers process all input tokens simultaneously, so they don't inherently know the order of the sequence (e.g., that day 5 comes before day 10).
    *   In classic NLP Transformers, "Positional Encodings" (fixed sinusoidal waves or learned embeddings) are added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the position of each token.
    *   In this `main.py` script for time series, the sequence order is inherently part of the input `(time_step, features)`. The initial `Dense` layer processes each point in the time step, and the learned weights in the network, including the self-attention mechanism operating over these sequence embeddings, can implicitly learn to utilize this order. While explicit positional encoding isn't added in the same way as in some NLP models, the network architecture is designed to work with ordered sequences.

5.  **Transformer Block (Encoder Layer)**:
    *   A single Transformer Block (or Encoder Layer) typically consists of:
        *   A Multi-Head Self-Attention layer.
        *   An "Add & Norm" step: The output of the attention layer is added to its input (a residual connection or skip connection), and the result is layer-normalized. Residual connections help prevent vanishing gradients in deep networks, making training easier. Layer normalization stabilizes the activations.
        *   A Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN): This is a simple fully connected neural network applied independently to each position (each time step's representation). It usually consists of two linear layers with a ReLU activation in between. This helps to further process and transform the information.
        *   Another "Add & Norm" step: The output of the FFN is added to its input, and the result is again layer-normalized.

6.  **Transformer Encoder**:
    *   The `main.py` script uses a `TransformerEncoder`, which is simply a stack of these Transformer Blocks. The output of one block becomes the input to the next. Stacking multiple blocks allows the model to learn increasingly complex patterns and representations from the data.

7.  **Output Layer for Forecasting**:
    *   After the input sequence has been processed by the Transformer Encoder, the output (which is still a sequence of context-aware representations) is typically flattened and passed through one or more `Dense` (fully connected) layers to produce the final forecast (e.g., the predicted stock price for the next time step).

By using these components, the Transformer can effectively capture complex dependencies across the time series, making it a powerful tool for forecasting. Now, let's dive into the code to see how these concepts are implemented!

## üèóÔ∏è Structured Code Walk-through

Now, let's dissect `main.py` section by section.

### 1. Imports and Setup

Every Python script starts by importing necessary libraries. This script also includes a common setup for using GPUs with TensorFlow if available.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Complete script to generate synthetic stock price data, build a Transformer-based time series forecasting model,
train it with TensorBoard and Visualkeras integration, evaluate its performance, and visualize predictions.
"""
import os
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, Dense, LayerNormalization, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras import Input
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import visualkeras

# Configure TensorFlow to use GPU if available
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Enable memory growth to prevent allocation issues
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(f"{len(gpus)} Physical GPUs, {len(logical_gpus)} Logical GPUs configured.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error setting up GPU memory growth: {e}")
else:
    print("No GPU detected, using CPU.")
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Shebang & Docstring**: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` ensures the script is run with Python 3. The docstring explains the script's overall purpose.
*   **Standard Libraries**:
    *   `os`: For interacting with the operating system, like creating directories for logs.
    *   `datetime`: To create unique timestamps for log directories.
*   **Data Handling Libraries**:
    *   `numpy as np`: Fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. Used for creating synthetic data and handling numerical arrays.
    *   `pandas as pd`: Powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. Used here to create a DataFrame for the synthetic stock prices.
*   **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Libraries**:
    *   `tensorflow as tf`: The core deep learning framework used to build and train the Transformer model.
    *   `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`: From Scikit-learn, used to scale the data to a specific range (usually 0 to 1), which helps the neural network learn more effectively.
    *   `tensorflow.keras.layers`: Specific layers from Keras (TensorFlow's high-level API) are imported: `Layer` (base class for custom layers), `Dense` (fully connected layer), `LayerNormalization`, and `Dropout`.
    *   `tensorflow.keras.models.Model`: Used to create the overall neural network model.
    *   `tensorflow.keras.Input`: Used to define the input shape of the model.
*   **Visualization Libraries**:
    *   `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: A popular plotting library used to visualize the true data and the model's predictions.
    *   `visualkeras`: A library to help visualize Keras model architectures.
*   **GPU Configuration**:
    *   `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`: This line checks if any GPUs are available that TensorFlow can use.
    *   `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)`: If GPUs are found, this is a crucial setting. It tells TensorFlow to only allocate GPU memory as needed, rather than grabbing all available memory at once. This prevents common out-of-memory errors when running multiple processes or if the GPU memory is limited.
    *   The `try-except` block handles potential errors during GPU setup.
    *   If no GPUs are detected, a message is printed, and the script will run on the CPU.

**Why it matters?**

*   Importing the right tools is the first step in any coding project.
*   Proper GPU setup ensures that the computationally intensive model training can leverage hardware acceleration if available, significantly speeding up the process. Memory growth configuration is a best practice for stable TensorFlow execution on GPUs.

### 2. The `MultiHeadSelfAttention` Class

This class implements the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism, which is a cornerstone of the Transformer architecture.

```python
class MultiHeadSelfAttention(Layer):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads=8):
        super(MultiHeadSelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.projection_dim = embed_dim // num_heads
        self.query_dense = Dense(embed_dim)
        self.key_dense = Dense(embed_dim)
        self.value_dense = Dense(embed_dim)
        self.combine_heads = Dense(embed_dim)

    def attention(self, query, key, value):
        score = tf.matmul(query, key, transpose_b=True)
        dim_key = tf.cast(tf.shape(key)[-1], tf.float32)
        scaled_score = score / tf.math.sqrt(dim_key)
        weights = tf.nn.softmax(scaled_score, axis=-1)
        output = tf.matmul(weights, value)
        return output, weights

    def split_heads(self, x, batch_size):
        x = tf.reshape(x, (batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.projection_dim))
        return tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

    def call(self, inputs):
        batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
        query = self.query_dense(inputs) 
        key = self.key_dense(inputs)   
        value = self.value_dense(inputs) 
        query = self.split_heads(query, batch_size) 
        key = self.split_heads(key, batch_size)   
        value = self.split_heads(value, batch_size) 
        attention_output, _ = self.attention(query, key, value)
        attention_output = tf.transpose(attention_output, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3]) 
        concat_attention = tf.reshape(attention_output, (batch_size, -1, self.embed_dim))
        return self.combine_heads(concat_attention)

```

**Explanation:**

This class inherits from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, making it a custom Keras layer.

*   **`__init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads=8)` (Constructor)**:
    *   `embed_dim`: The dimensionality of the input embeddings (and also the output). For example, if each time step is represented by a vector of size 128, `embed_dim` is 128.
    *   `num_heads`: The number of attention heads. As discussed in the introduction, this means we'll have multiple parallel attention calculations.
    *   `self.projection_dim = embed_dim // num_heads`: The dimensionality for each attention head. The `embed_dim` is split across the `num_heads`. It's important that `embed_dim` is divisible by `num_heads`.
    *   `self.query_dense = Dense(embed_dim)`: A dense (fully connected) layer to transform the input into the Query (Q) representation for all heads combined initially.
    *   `self.key_dense = Dense(embed_dim)`: A dense layer to transform the input into the Key (K) representation.
    *   `self.value_dense = Dense(embed_dim)`: A dense layer to transform the input into the Value (V) representation.
    *   `self.combine_heads = Dense(embed_dim)`: A final dense layer to combine the outputs of all attention heads.

*   **`attention(self, query, key, value)` (Scaled Dot-Product Attention)**:
    *   This method implements the core attention logic for a single head (after Q, K, V have been appropriately shaped for that head).
    *   `score = tf.matmul(query, key, transpose_b=True)`: Calculates the dot product between the Query and the Key (transposed). This gives a raw score of how much each query element aligns with each key element.
    *   `dim_key = tf.cast(tf.shape(key)[-1], tf.float32)`: Gets the dimension of the key vectors.
    *   `scaled_score = score / tf.math.sqrt(dim_key)`: Scales the scores by dividing by the square root of the key dimension. This scaling factor is crucial to prevent the dot products from becoming too large, which could lead to very small gradients in the softmax function, hindering training.
    *   `weights = tf.nn.softmax(scaled_score, axis=-1)`: Applies the softmax function along the last axis (the key dimension) to the scaled scores. This converts the scores into probability-like attention weights, which sum up to 1. These weights determine how much of each value element should be considered.
    *   `output = tf.matmul(weights, value)`: Computes the weighted sum of the Value vectors using the attention weights. This is the output of the attention mechanism ‚Äì a representation where each element is a blend of other elements, weighted by their importance.
    *   **Returns**: The attention output and the attention weights (the weights can be useful for visualization and understanding what the model is focusing on, though they are not used further in this specific `call` method's main path).

*   **`split_heads(self, x, batch_size)`**:
    *   This utility method reshapes the input tensor `x` (which could be Q, K, or V after the initial dense transformation) to prepare it for multi-head processing.
    *   `x = tf.reshape(x, (batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.projection_dim))`: Reshapes `x` so that the last two dimensions are `num_heads` and `projection_dim`. The `-1` infers the sequence length.
        *   Input `x` shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`
        *   Reshaped `x` shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, projection_dim)`
    *   `return tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])`: Transposes the tensor to group all heads together for parallel computation.
        *   Transposed `x` shape: `(batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, projection_dim)`

*   **`call(self, inputs)` (Forward Pass)**:
    *   This is the main method executed when data is passed through the layer.
    *   `batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]`: Gets the batch size from the input tensor.
    *   `query = self.query_dense(inputs)`: Generates the Query tensor by passing the input through the `query_dense` layer. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `key = self.key_dense(inputs)`: Generates the Key tensor. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `value = self.value_dense(inputs)`: Generates the Value tensor. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `query = self.split_heads(query, batch_size)`: Reshapes and transposes the Query tensor for multi-head attention. Shape: `(batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, projection_dim)`.
    *   `key = self.split_heads(key, batch_size)`: Same for the Key tensor.
    *   `value = self.split_heads(value, batch_size)`: Same for the Value tensor.
    *   `attention_output, _ = self.attention(query, key, value)`: Computes the attention output using the prepared Q, K, V. The `attention` method is applied independently to each head because of the tensor shapes.
        *   `attention_output` shape: `(batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, projection_dim)`.
    *   `attention_output = tf.transpose(attention_output, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])`: Transposes the attention output back to bring the sequence length dimension before the number of heads. This is to prepare for concatenation.
        *   Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, projection_dim)`.
    *   `concat_attention = tf.reshape(attention_output, (batch_size, -1, self.embed_dim))`: Concatenates the outputs from all heads by reshaping the tensor. The `num_heads` and `projection_dim` dimensions are merged back into the original `embed_dim`.
        *   Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `return self.combine_heads(concat_attention)`: Passes the concatenated attention output through a final dense layer. This allows the model to learn how to best combine the information from different heads.
        *   Output shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.

**Why it matters?**

*   This class is the engine of the Transformer. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing any given part.
*   Multi-head attention allows the model to capture different types of relationships or contexts simultaneously from different representational subspaces.
*   The use of dense layers for Q, K, V projections and for combining heads means these transformations are learned during training, making the attention mechanism highly adaptable.

**Interactions:**

*   This `MultiHeadSelfAttention` layer is a core component used within the `TransformerBlock` class.
*   It takes the sequence of embeddings as input and outputs a new sequence of context-aware embeddings of the same shape.

### 3. The `TransformerBlock` Class

A Transformer model is typically made up of a stack of these `TransformerBlock` (or Encoder Layer) units. Each block contains a multi-head self-attention layer and a feed-forward network, with normalization and dropout.

```python
class TransformerBlock(Layer):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()
        self.att = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        self.ffn = tf.keras.Sequential([
            Dense(ff_dim, activation="relu"),
            Dense(embed_dim),
        ])
        self.layernorm1 = LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.layernorm2 = LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.dropout1 = Dropout(rate)
        self.dropout2 = Dropout(rate)

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        attn_output = self.att(inputs)
        attn_output = self.dropout1(attn_output, training=training)
        out1 = self.layernorm1(inputs + attn_output) # Add & Norm
        ffn_output = self.ffn(out1)
        ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output, training=training)
        return self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output) # Add & Norm
```

**Explanation:**

This class also inherits from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.

*   **`__init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1)` (Constructor)**:
    *   `embed_dim`: Dimensionality of the input/output embeddings (same as in `MultiHeadSelfAttention`).
    *   `num_heads`: Number of attention heads for the internal `MultiHeadSelfAttention` layer.
    *   `ff_dim`: The dimensionality of the inner layer of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). The FFN typically expands the `embed_dim` to `ff_dim` and then projects it back to `embed_dim`.
    *   `rate=0.1`: The dropout rate. Dropout is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
    *   `self.att = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)`: Instantiates the multi-head self-attention layer we just discussed.
    *   `self.ffn = tf.keras.Sequential([...])`: Defines the Position-wise Feed-Forward Network. It's a simple sequence of two dense layers:
        *   `Dense(ff_dim, activation="relu")`: The first dense layer expands the dimension to `ff_dim` and uses a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function.
        *   `Dense(embed_dim)`: The second dense layer projects the dimension back to `embed_dim`.
    *   `self.layernorm1 = LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)`: The first layer normalization instance. `epsilon` is a small float added to variance to avoid division by zero.
    *   `self.layernorm2 = LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)`: The second layer normalization instance.
    *   `self.dropout1 = Dropout(rate)`: The first dropout layer, applied after the attention output.
    *   `self.dropout2 = Dropout(rate)`: The second dropout layer, applied after the FFN output.

*   **`call(self, inputs, training=False)` (Forward Pass)**:
    *   `inputs`: The input tensor to the Transformer block, typically the output from a previous block or the initial embedded input. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `training=False`: A boolean flag indicating whether the layer is being run in training mode or inference mode. This is important for layers like `Dropout`, which behave differently during training (apply dropout) and inference (do nothing).
    *   `attn_output = self.att(inputs)`: Passes the input through the multi-head self-attention layer. Output shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `attn_output = self.dropout1(attn_output, training=training)`: Applies dropout to the attention output. During training, some elements of `attn_output` will be randomly zeroed out.
    *   `out1 = self.layernorm1(inputs + attn_output)`: This is the first "Add & Norm" step.
        *   `inputs + attn_output`: A residual connection (or skip connection). The original input to the attention layer is added to its output. This helps in training deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily and enabling the layer to learn modifications to the identity function.
        *   `self.layernorm1(...)`: The sum is then passed through layer normalization. Layer normalization helps stabilize the learning process by normalizing the inputs to activations in a layer across the features dimension.
    *   `ffn_output = self.ffn(out1)`: Passes the output of the first Add & Norm step (`out1`) through the feed-forward network.
    *   `ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output, training=training)`: Applies dropout to the FFN output.
    *   `return self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output)`: This is the second "Add & Norm" step.
        *   `out1 + ffn_output`: Another residual connection, adding the input of the FFN (`out1`) to its output.
        *   `self.layernorm2(...)`: The sum is passed through the second layer normalization.
    *   The method returns the final output of the Transformer block. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.

**Why it matters?**

*   This block combines self-attention (to understand context within the sequence) with a feed-forward network (to further process each position independently).
*   **Residual Connections (`inputs + attn_output` and `out1 + ffn_output`)**: These are crucial. They allow the network to be built much deeper. Imagine the network needs to learn a very complex transformation. The residual connection makes it easier for a layer to learn a small change (the residual) to its input, rather than learning the entire transformation from scratch. If a layer isn't very useful, the gradient flow can effectively bypass it through the skip connection.
*   **Layer Normalization**: This helps to keep the activations in a reasonable range throughout the network, leading to more stable and faster training.
*   **Dropout**: Helps prevent the model from overfitting to the training data by making it more robust.

**Interactions:**

*   Uses the `MultiHeadSelfAttention` class internally.
*   Multiple instances of `TransformerBlock` are typically stacked to form the `TransformerEncoder`.
*   The `training` parameter is passed down from the model's `fit` or `predict` methods, ensuring dropout behaves correctly.

### 4. The `TransformerEncoder` Class

The `TransformerEncoder` simply stacks multiple `TransformerBlock` layers one after another. The more layers you stack, the more complex relationships the model can potentially learn, but also the more computationally expensive and prone to overfitting it might become.

```python
class TransformerEncoder(Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_layers, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1):
        super(TransformerEncoder, self).__init__()
        self.enc_layers = [TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate)
                           for _ in range(num_layers)]
        self.dropout = Dropout(rate) # This dropout is on the input to the encoder stack

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = inputs
        # The original implementation in the file did not seem to use self.dropout(inputs, training=training) on initial input `x`.
        # If it were to be used, it would typically be: x = self.dropout(inputs, training=training)
        # However, a dropout is often applied to the *input embeddings* before they enter the encoder stack.
        # The provided code has a self.dropout initialized but not explicitly used on the initial input `x` in its `call` method.
        # Let's assume the intent was dropout on embeddings *before* or *after* the embedding layer, or this is a residual dropout for future use.
        # The current loop passes `x` directly. Each TransformerBlock has its own internal dropouts.

        for layer in self.enc_layers:
            x = layer(x, training=training)
        return x
```

**Explanation:**

This class also inherits from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.

*   **`__init__(self, num_layers, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1)` (Constructor)**:
    *   `num_layers`: The number of `TransformerBlock` layers to stack in the encoder.
    *   `embed_dim`, `num_heads`, `ff_dim`, `rate`: These parameters are passed down to each `TransformerBlock` when it's created.
    *   `self.enc_layers = [TransformerBlock(...) for _ in range(num_layers)]`: This line uses a list comprehension to create a list containing `num_layers` instances of `TransformerBlock`. Each block is initialized with the specified hyperparameters.
    *   `self.dropout = Dropout(rate)`: A dropout layer is initialized here. 
        *   **Note on usage**: In the provided `call` method of `TransformerEncoder`, this specific `self.dropout` instance isn't explicitly applied to the initial `inputs` before they go into the loop of `enc_layers`. Often, a dropout layer is applied to the input embeddings *before* they enter the first `TransformerBlock`. Since each `TransformerBlock` already has its own internal dropout layers, this particular `self.dropout` might be intended for the input to the entire encoder stack if it were used, or it's a leftover. For this explanation, we'll focus on how the code *is* written. The primary dropout actions occur *within* each `TransformerBlock`.

*   **`call(self, inputs, training=False)` (Forward Pass)**:
    *   `inputs`: The input tensor to the encoder, typically the sequence of embeddings. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.
    *   `training=False`: Boolean flag passed to each `TransformerBlock` for its internal dropout layers.
    *   `x = inputs`: Initializes `x` with the input tensor.
    *   `for layer in self.enc_layers:`: Iterates through each `TransformerBlock` in the `self.enc_layers` list.
        *   `x = layer(x, training=training)`: Passes the current state of `x` through the current `TransformerBlock`. The output of one block becomes the input to the next.
    *   `return x`: Returns the output of the final `TransformerBlock` in the stack. This output is a sequence of highly contextualized embeddings. Shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)`.

**Why it matters?**

*   Stacking layers allows the model to build up more abstract and complex representations of the input data. The first layer might learn simple local patterns, while deeper layers can combine these to learn more global, intricate patterns.
*   The `num_layers` hyperparameter controls the depth of the encoder. Finding the right depth is often a matter of experimentation for a given task.

**Interactions:**

*   This class is composed of multiple `TransformerBlock` instances.
*   It will be used as a major component in the `build_model` function to create the main processing part of the time series forecaster.
*   The output of the `TransformerEncoder` will typically be flattened and fed into a final dense layer (or layers) to produce the actual forecast.

### 5. Utility Function: `create_dataset`

This function is responsible for transforming a raw time series into a format suitable for training a supervised learning model. Specifically, it creates input sequences (X) and corresponding target values (Y).

```python
def create_dataset(data, time_step=1):
    X, Y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_step - 1):
        X.append(data[i:(i + time_step), 0])
        Y.append(data[i + time_step, 0])
    return np.array(X), np.array(Y)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Function Signature**: `create_dataset(data, time_step=1)`
    *   `data`: This is expected to be a 2D NumPy array where each row is a time step and columns are features. In this script, it will be the scaled stock price data, so it will have shape `(num_samples, 1)`. The `[:, 0]` indexing inside the loop suggests it specifically expects the first (and only) feature.
    *   `time_step`: An integer that defines the length of the input sequences. For example, if `time_step` is 100, the model will use the data from the past 100 time steps to predict the value at the next time step.

*   **Initialization**: `X, Y = [], []`
    *   Two empty lists, `X` and `Y`, are initialized. `X` will store the input sequences, and `Y` will store the corresponding target values.

*   **Looping through the data**: `for i in range(len(data) - time_step - 1):`
    *   The loop iterates through the `data` to create sliding windows.
    *   The loop runs up to `len(data) - time_step - 1`. Let's break down why:
        *   `len(data) - time_step`: This would be the starting index of the last possible sequence of length `time_step`.
        *   The additional `-1` is because we also need one more data point *after* this sequence to serve as the target `Y`.
        *   So, `i + time_step` will be the index of the target value, and `i + time_step -1` is the last index of the input sequence.

*   **Creating Sequences and Targets**:
    *   `X.append(data[i:(i + time_step), 0])`:
        *   `data[i:(i + time_step), 0]` selects a slice from the input `data`. It takes `time_step` consecutive rows (from index `i` up to, but not including, `i + time_step`) and selects the first column (`0`). This forms one input sequence.
        *   This sequence is appended to the list `X`.
        *   **Example**: If `time_step` is 3, and `i` is 0, this would take `data[0:3, 0]` (i.e., data from time 0, 1, 2) as the input sequence.
    *   `Y.append(data[i + time_step, 0])`:
        *   `data[i + time_step, 0]` selects the data point immediately following the end of the current input sequence. This is the value the model should try to predict.
        *   This target value is appended to the list `Y`.
        *   **Example**: Continuing the above, the target `Y` would be `data[3, 0]` (data from time 3).

*   **Returning NumPy Arrays**: `return np.array(X), np.array(Y)`
    *   Finally, the lists `X` and `Y` are converted into NumPy arrays and returned. Neural networks typically expect their inputs as NumPy arrays (or TensorFlow tensors).
    *   Shape of `X` will be `(num_sequences, time_step)`.
    *   Shape of `Y` will be `(num_sequences,)`.

**Why it matters?**

*   Most time series forecasting models, especially supervised ones, require data to be structured into input sequences and corresponding target outputs.
*   This function implements a common "sliding window" technique to generate these required structures.
*   The `time_step` parameter is crucial: it defines the "look-back" window the model uses for making predictions. A larger `time_step` gives the model more past information but also increases computational requirements and can make it harder to train if the relevant information is more recent.

**Real-world Analogy:**

Imagine you're trying to predict tomorrow's temperature. You might look at the temperatures for the last 7 days (`time_step = 7`).
*   Days 1-7 become your input sequence `X`.
*   Day 8's temperature becomes your target `Y`.
Then you slide the window: Days 2-8 become another `X`, and Day 9's temperature is the new `Y`, and so on.

**Interactions:**

*   This function is called in the `main()` part of the script after the data has been generated and scaled.
*   The `X` and `Y` arrays produced by this function are then used to train and evaluate the Transformer model.
*   The `X` array will later be reshaped to `(num_sequences, time_step, 1)` because neural network layers for sequences (like LSTMs or the input to our Transformer) often expect a 3D input: `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features_per_step)`.

### 6. The `build_model` Function

This function defines the architecture of our Transformer-based time series forecasting model using the Keras Functional API.

```python
def build_model(time_step,
                embed_dim=128,
                num_heads=8,
                ff_dim=512,
                num_layers=4,
                dropout_rate=0.1):
    """
    Build and return a Transformer-based time series forecasting model.
    """
    inputs = Input(shape=(time_step, 1))
    x = Dense(embed_dim)(inputs) # Initial embedding layer
    encoder = TransformerEncoder(num_layers, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=dropout_rate)
    x = encoder(x) # Pass embedded input through the Transformer Encoder
    x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x) # Flatten the output of the encoder
    x = Dropout(dropout_rate)(x) # Apply dropout before the final dense layer
    outputs = Dense(1)(x) # Output layer to predict a single value
    return Model(inputs, outputs)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Function Signature and Parameters**: `build_model(time_step, embed_dim=128, ...)`
    *   `time_step`: The length of the input sequence (e.g., 100 past data points).
    *   `embed_dim=128`: The dimensionality of the embedding space. Each of the `time_step` input points (which initially has 1 feature) will be projected into a vector of this size.
    *   `num_heads=8`: Number of attention heads in each `MultiHeadSelfAttention` layer within the `TransformerBlock`s.
    *   `ff_dim=512`: The dimensionality of the inner layer in the feed-forward networks within each `TransformerBlock`.
    *   `num_layers=4`: The number of `TransformerBlock` layers to stack in the `TransformerEncoder`.
    *   `dropout_rate=0.1`: The dropout rate to be used within the `TransformerEncoder` and before the final output layer.

*   **Model Architecture (Keras Functional API style)**:

    1.  **`inputs = Input(shape=(time_step, 1))`**: Defines the input layer of the model.
        *   `shape=(time_step, 1)`: This specifies that the model expects input data with `time_step` time steps, and at each time step, there is 1 feature (e.g., the stock price).
        *   The Keras Functional API starts by defining an `Input` object.

    2.  **`x = Dense(embed_dim)(inputs)`**: This is the initial embedding layer.
        *   It's a `Dense` (fully connected) layer that takes the `inputs`.
        *   It transforms each of the `time_step` points from having 1 feature to having `embed_dim` features. Essentially, it learns a richer representation (embedding) for each point in the input sequence.
        *   The output `x` will have the shape `(batch_size, time_step, embed_dim)`.
        *   This layer is crucial. The self-attention mechanisms in the Transformer work on these embeddings.

    3.  **`encoder = TransformerEncoder(num_layers, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=dropout_rate)`**: Instantiates the `TransformerEncoder` class we discussed earlier, using the provided hyperparameters.

    4.  **`x = encoder(x)`**: Passes the embedded input sequence `x` through the entire stack of Transformer encoder layers.
        *   The `encoder` will process this sequence, applying self-attention and feed-forward networks at each layer to capture complex dependencies.
        *   The output `x` from the encoder will still be a sequence of embeddings, with the same shape as its input: `(batch_size, time_step, embed_dim)`. However, these embeddings are now context-aware.

    5.  **`x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)`**: Flattens the output of the encoder.
        *   The `TransformerEncoder` outputs a sequence of shape `(batch_size, time_step, embed_dim)`. To predict a single output value, we need to convert this 3D tensor into a 2D tensor.
        *   The `Flatten` layer reshapes it to `(batch_size, time_step * embed_dim)`, effectively concatenating all the features from all time steps of the encoder's output into one long vector per batch item.

    6.  **`x = Dropout(dropout_rate)(x)`**: Applies dropout to the flattened output.
        *   This is a regularization step before the final prediction layer to help prevent overfitting.

    7.  **`outputs = Dense(1)(x)`**: The final output layer.
        *   It's a `Dense` layer with a single neuron (`1`) because we are performing univariate time series forecasting ‚Äì predicting a single value (the next stock price).
        *   It typically uses a linear activation function by default, which is suitable for regression tasks like predicting a continuous value.
        *   The output `outputs` will have the shape `(batch_size, 1)`.

    8.  **`return Model(inputs, outputs)`**: Creates and returns the Keras `Model` instance.
        *   The `Model` is defined by specifying its input tensor(s) (`inputs`) and output tensor(s) (`outputs`). Keras then automatically traces the graph of layers connecting these inputs to outputs.

**Why it matters?**

*   This function encapsulates the entire neural network architecture, making it easy to create and modify.
*   It clearly shows how the custom Transformer components (`TransformerEncoder`) are integrated with standard Keras layers (`Input`, `Dense`, `Flatten`, `Dropout`) to build a complete model.
*   The choice of hyperparameters (like `embed_dim`, `num_heads`, `num_layers`) significantly impacts the model's capacity and performance. These are often tuned based on the specific dataset and problem.

**Interactions:**

*   This function uses the `TransformerEncoder` class.
*   The model created by this function is then compiled (with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics) and trained in the `main()` function.

### 7. The `main()` Function: Orchestrating the Workflow

The `main()` function is where all the previously defined components and steps come together to execute the time series forecasting task from start to finish.

```python
def main():
    # 1. Generate synthetic stock price data
    np.random.seed(42) # for reproducibility
    data_length = 2000
    trend = np.linspace(100, 200, data_length)
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 2, data_length)
    synthetic_data = trend + noise
    df = pd.DataFrame(synthetic_data, columns=['Close'])

    # 2. Normalize data
    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Close']].values)

    # 3. Prepare dataset for training
    time_step = 100
    X, Y = create_dataset(scaled_data, time_step)
    X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)) # Reshape X for the model

    # 4. Build and compile model
    model = build_model(time_step,
                        embed_dim=128,
                        num_heads=8,

        optimizer='adam',
        loss='mse', # Mean Squared Error
        metrics=['mae', tf.keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError(name='rmse')]
    )
    model.summary() # Print model architecture

    # 5. Setup TensorBoard and Visualkeras logging
    logdir = os.path.join("logs", datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))
    os.makedirs(logdir, exist_ok=True)
    arch_path = os.path.join(logdir, 'model_visualkeras.png')

        img = tf.image.decode_png(img, channels=4)
        tf.summary.image("Model Visualization", tf.expand_dims(img, 0), step=0)

    tensorboard_cb = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(
        log_dir=logdir,

    )

    # 7. Evaluate model (on the same X, Y data - ideally use a separate test set)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

**Explanation of Steps in `main()`:**

1.  **Generate Synthetic Stock Price Data**
    *   `np.random.seed(42)`: Sets the random seed for NumPy. This ensures that if you run the script multiple times, the same "random" data will be generated, making your results reproducible.
    *   `data_length = 2000`: Defines the total number of data points for our synthetic time series.
    *   `trend = np.linspace(100, 200, data_length)`: Creates a simple linear upward trend from 100 to 200 over `data_length` points.
    *   `noise = np.random.normal(0, 2, data_length)`: Generates random noise from a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2. This makes the data look a bit more realistic than a perfect straight line.
    *   `synthetic_data = trend + noise`: Adds the trend and noise together to create the final synthetic stock price data.
    *   `df = pd.DataFrame(synthetic_data, columns=['Close'])`: Converts the NumPy array of synthetic data into a Pandas DataFrame with a single column named 'Close'. DataFrames provide convenient ways to handle and view tabular data.

2.  **Normalize Data**
    *   `scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))`: Initializes a `MinMaxScaler` from Scikit-learn. This scaler will transform the data so that all values fall within the range of 0 to 1.
    *   `scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Close']].values)`: Fits the scaler to the 'Close' price data (calculates the min and max values from this data) and then transforms the data into the 0-1 range. `df[['Close']].values` extracts the 'Close' column as a NumPy array, which is what the scaler expects.
    *   **Why normalize?** Neural networks often perform better and train faster when input features are on a similar scale and within a small range. It prevents features with larger values from dominating the learning process and helps with gradient stability.

3.  **Prepare Dataset for Training**
    *   `time_step = 100`: Sets the look-back window. The model will use 100 past data points to predict the next one.
    *   `X, Y = create_dataset(scaled_data, time_step)`: Calls the `create_dataset` function (discussed earlier) to convert the `scaled_data` into input sequences `X` and target values `Y`.
    *   `X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))`: Reshapes the input data `X`. 
        *   Initially, `X` from `create_dataset` has a shape like `(num_sequences, time_step)`. 
        *   The Transformer model (and many other Keras sequence models like LSTMs) expects a 3D input: `(batch_size/num_samples, sequence_length, num_features_per_step)`. 
        *   Here, `X.shape[0]` is the number of sequences, `X.shape[1]` is the `time_step` (sequence length), and `1` indicates that at each time step, we have 1 feature (the scaled price).

4.  **Build and Compile Model**
    *   `model = build_model(...)`: Calls the `build_model` function (discussed earlier) to create our Transformer model instance with specified hyperparameters (`time_step=100`, `embed_dim=128`, etc.).
    *   `model.compile(...)`: Configures the model for training.
        *   `optimizer='adam'`: Specifies the Adam optimizer. Adam is a popular and generally effective optimization algorithm for training neural networks.
        *   `loss='mse'`: Sets the loss function to Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE is a common choice for regression tasks, as it heavily penalizes large errors.
        *   `metrics=['mae', tf.keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError(name='rmse')]`: Specifies metrics to be monitored during training and evaluation.
            *   `'mae'`: Mean Absolute Error. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It's less sensitive to outliers than MSE.
            *   `tf.keras.metrics.RootMeanSquaredError(name='rmse')`: Root Mean Squared Error. It's the square root of the MSE, so it's in the same units as the target variable, making it more interpretable.
    *   `model.summary()`: Prints a summary of the model architecture, showing the layers, output shapes, and number of parameters. This is very useful for verifying the model structure.

5.  **Setup TensorBoard and Visualkeras Logging**
    *   **TensorBoard**: A visualization toolkit provided with TensorFlow. It helps you track and visualize various aspects of your model training, such as loss and metrics over epochs, the model graph, and histograms of weights and biases.
    *   `logdir = os.path.join("logs", datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))`: Creates a unique directory path for storing TensorBoard logs. The directory name includes the current date and time to keep different runs separate.
    *   `os.makedirs(logdir, exist_ok=True)`: Creates the log directory if it doesn't already exist.
    *   **Visualkeras**: This part generates an image of the model architecture using `visualkeras`.
        *   `arch_path = os.path.join(logdir, 'model_visualkeras.png')`: Defines the path to save the architecture image.
        *   `visualkeras.layered_view(...)`: Creates a layered plot of the model and saves it to `arch_path`.
        *   The subsequent `with tf.summary.create_file_writer...` block reads this saved image and logs it to TensorBoard, so you can see the model architecture directly within the TensorBoard UI.
    *   `tensorboard_cb = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(...)`: Creates a TensorBoard callback.
        *   Callbacks are objects that can perform actions at various stages of training (e.g., at the end of each epoch).
        *   `log_dir=logdir`: Specifies where to save the logs.
        *   `histogram_freq=1`: Computes and logs histograms of weights and biases every epoch (can be computationally intensive).
        *   `write_graph=True`: Logs the model graph.
        *   `write_images=True`: If true, model weights are visualized as images in TensorBoard.
        *   `update_freq='epoch'`: Updates TensorBoard logs after every epoch.
        *   `profile_batch=1`: Enables profiling for the specified batch(es) to analyze performance. `1` profiles the first batch. Can be set to `0` to disable or a range e.g., `(100, 200)`.
    *   The `print` statements provide the path to the log directory and the command to launch TensorBoard.

6.  **Train Model**
    *   `history = model.fit(...)`: This is where the model training happens.
        *   `X`, `Y`: The training data (input sequences and target values).
        *   `epochs=20`: The number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset. One epoch is one full pass through the training data.
        *   `batch_size=32`: The number of training samples to process before updating the model's weights. The data is broken into batches of this size.
        *   `validation_split=0.1`: Reserves 10% of the training data to be used as validation data. The model's performance on this validation set is monitored during training to check for overfitting (i.e., the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
        *   `callbacks=[tensorboard_cb]`: Passes the TensorBoard callback to the training process, so it logs data as training progresses.
    *   The `model.fit()` method returns a `History` object, which contains a record of training loss values and metrics values at successive epochs, as well as validation loss values and validation metrics values (if applicable).

7.  **Evaluate Model**
    *   `loss_metrics = model.evaluate(X, Y)`: Evaluates the trained model's performance on the provided data.
        *   **Important Note**: In this script, the model is evaluated on the *same* data (`X`, `Y`) that was used for training (or a portion of it, if `validation_split` was used). **For a proper assessment of generalization, you should always evaluate your model on a separate, unseen test set.** This script is a demonstration, but in a real-world scenario, you'd split your data into training, validation, and test sets *before* training.
        *   The `evaluate` method returns the loss value and any metrics specified during `model.compile()`. In this case, it will return a list: `[loss (MSE), mae, rmse]`.
    *   The `print` statements display these evaluation metrics.

8.  **Make Predictions**
    *   `predictions = model.predict(X)`: Uses the trained model to make predictions on the input data `X`. Again, ideally, this would be on new, unseen data.
    *   The `predictions` will be in the scaled range (0 to 1) because the model was trained on scaled data.
    *   `predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)`: Reverts the scaling on the predictions to get them back into the original stock price range. This uses the `scaler` object that was fitted earlier.

9.  **Plot Results**
    *   `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))`: Creates a new Matplotlib figure for plotting with a specified size.
    *   `plt.plot(df['Close'].values, label='True Data')`: Plots the original, unscaled true stock prices.
    *   `plot_range = np.arange(time_step + 1, time_step + 1 + len(predictions))`: Creates an array of indices for the x-axis of the predictions plot. Predictions start after the initial `time_step` period (since the first `Y` value corresponds to `data[time_step]`, but our `create_dataset` goes up to `len(data) - time_step - 1`, meaning the first `Y` is `data[time_step]`. The `Y` values correspond to indices `time_step` to `len(data)-2`. The predictions `model.predict(X)` will have `len(Y)` items. The first X uses data up to `time_step-1` to predict `time_step`. The first Y is `scaled_data[time_step]`. So `predictions[0]` corresponds to the original data at index `time_step`. The `df['Close'].values` has `data_length` points. The number of `Y` values is `data_length - time_step -1`. The predictions should align with these `Y` values. So, predictions correspond to original data from index `time_step` up to `time_step + len(predictions) - 1`. The `arange` should correctly be `np.arange(time_step, time_step + len(predictions))` if `Y` is `data[i + time_step, 0]` and `X` is `data[i:(i + time_step), 0]`.
        *   Let's re-check the indexing for plotting: `create_dataset` uses `Y.append(data[i + time_step, 0])`. The loop for `i` goes from `0` to `len(data) - time_step - 2`. So, `Y[0]` is `data[time_step]`. `predictions[0]` will correspond to this. The x-axis for predictions should thus start at index `time_step` of the original data.
        *   So `plot_range = np.arange(time_step, time_step + len(predictions))` seems more accurate for aligning `predictions[0]` with `df['Close'].values[time_step]`.
        *   The script uses `np.arange(time_step, time_step + len(predictions))` in its original plotting line (line 219: `plt.plot(np.arange(time_step, time_step + len(predictions)), predictions, label='Predictions')`). My current `main.py` uses `np.arange(time_step + 1, time_step + 1 + len(predictions))`. Let's stick to what's in *this* `main.py` (line 219 of the provided file) which is `np.arange(time_step, time_step + len(predictions))`. The explanation text in my template has `time_step+1`. I will correct this in the final output. **Correction for plotting range based on provided file**: the `plt.plot` for predictions uses `np.arange(time_step, time_step + len(predictions))`. This aligns `predictions[0]` (which forecasts for time `time_step`) with the `time_step`-th point on the x-axis of the true data plot.
    *   `plt.plot(plot_range, predictions, label='Predictions')`: Plots the model's (inverse-transformed) predictions against the calculated x-axis range.
    *   `plt.title(...)`, `plt.xlabel(...)`, `plt.ylabel(...)`, `plt.legend()`: Add title, labels, and a legend to the plot for clarity.
    *   `plt.show()`: Displays the plot.

*   **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block**
    *   This is a standard Python construct. It ensures that the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly (e.g., by running `python main.py`), and not when it's imported as a module into another script.

**Why `main()` matters?**

*   It provides a clear, step-by-step execution flow for the entire machine learning pipeline.
*   It demonstrates how to integrate data generation, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization in a single script.
*   It serves as the primary entry point for running the experiment.

**Key Takeaways from `main()` for Beginners:**

*   **Reproducibility**: Using `np.random.seed()` is good practice.
*   **Data Scaling**: Essential for many neural network models.
*   **Input Reshaping**: Pay close attention to the expected input shapes of Keras layers.
*   **Model Compilation**: Choosing the right optimizer, loss, and metrics is crucial.
*   **Callbacks (TensorBoard)**: Powerful for monitoring and debugging training.
*   **Training & Evaluation**: Understand the roles of `fit()` and `evaluate()`. Crucially, remember to use a separate test set for true generalization assessment in real projects.
*   **Inverse Transform**: Don't forget to convert predictions back to the original scale if you scaled your data.

This concludes the detailed walk-through of `main.py`! I hope this gives you a solid understanding of how a Transformer model can be built and applied to time series forecasting.
