# MCPFromScratch: Building a Model Context Protocol Server from Scratch

Welcome to **MCPFromScratch** - a comprehensive educational project that demonstrates how to build a complete client-server application using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from the ground up.

## 🎯 What This Project Teaches

This repository is designed to help you understand:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: How intelligent agents communicate with service providers
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A custom protocol for AI agents to discover and use server capabilities
- **Modern Python Web Development**: Using FastAPI, WebSockets, and async/await patterns
- **AI Integration**: How to build agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based persistent connections for dynamic interactions

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

- **Server** (`MCPFromScratch/server/`): A FastAPI-based server that provides tools, prompts, and resources
- **Client** (`MCPFromScratch/client/`): An intelligent agent that connects to the server and processes user queries

## 📚 Get Started with the Interactive Guide

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **OpenAI API**: LLM integration for intelligent responses
- **SQLite**: Database for server-side data storage
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous programming for high performance

## 🚀 What You'll Build

By following this project, you'll create:

1. **A Capable Server** that offers:
   - Tools (like calculators, database queries, text-to-SQL conversion)
   - Prompts (templates for LLM interactions)
   - Resources (configuration and user data access)

2. **An Intelligent Client** that:
   - Connects to the server via WebSocket
   - Understands natural language queries
   - Selects appropriate tools automatically
   - Provides conversational responses

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: Open [`notebook.ipynb`](notebook.ipynb) for the complete guide
2. **Explore the Code**: Examine the server and client implementations
3. **Run the Application**: Follow the setup instructions in the notebook
4. **Experiment**: Try adding your own tools, prompts, or resources

## 📖 Key Concepts Covered

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Custom communication protocol design
- **WebSocket Session Management**: Handling persistent connections
- **API Authentication**: Secure access with API keys and quotas
- **Schema Validation**: Using Pydantic for robust data handling
- **LLM Integration**: Building AI-powered applications
- **Async Programming**: Modern Python concurrency patterns
