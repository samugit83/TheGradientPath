# Welcome to TheGradientPath

A curated learning journey through modern machine learning and artificial intelligence.

This repository blends concise Python scripts, richly commented Jupyter notebooks, and step-by-step video tutorials to help you build intuition from first principles to state-of-the-art models. Every concept is paired with runnable code so you can tinker, break things, and understand the gradients under the hood.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Chapters progress from linear regression and basic optimization all the way to transformers, diffusion models, and reinforcement learning.
*   **Modular Structure:** Each module is self-contained, with clear prerequisites, learning goals, and suggested reading for deeper dives.
*   **Interactive & Practical Code:** The `notebooks/` directory is designed for interactive experimentation, while the `scripts/` folder shows how to productionize the same ideas.
*   **Visual Learning:** Short, captioned videos accompany the trickier topics, providing visual intuition and live-coding sessions.
*   **Accessibility:** All examples favor open-source datasets and libraries, ensuring you can follow along on a laptop without expensive hardware.
