# ðŸš€ Hybrid Multivector Knowledge Graph RAG System

## Revolutionary AI System with 11+ Advanced Graph Traversal Algorithms

Welcome to the most advanced hybrid RAG system tutorial - where traditional vector similarity search meets the sophisticated intelligence of graph databases to create AI that truly understands complex relationships between concepts, entities, and ideas.

### ðŸŒŸ What Makes This Special?

This isn't just another RAG tutorial. This repository contains the complete implementation of a **hybrid retrieval system** that:

- **ðŸ§  Thinks Beyond Surface-Level Similarity**: Discovers hidden connections across multiple degrees of separation
- **ðŸ”— Navigates Complex Knowledge Networks**: Follows chains of reasoning and traces causal relationships
- **âš¡ Adapts Intelligence Dynamically**: Uses LLM-powered query generation and intelligent filtering

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Knowledge Graph Engineering** with Neo4j
- **Multi-Vector Embedding Strategy** for nuanced retrieval
- **11+ Advanced Graph Traversal Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, A*, Beam Search, Context-to-Cypher)
- **LLM-Powered Intelligence** for entity extraction and dynamic queries
- **Production-Ready Architecture** with comprehensive error handling

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Initialize Knowledge Graph**: `python ingestion.py`
2. **Start Querying**: `python query.py`
3. **Explore Visually**: Open Neo4j Browser at `http://localhost:7474`
